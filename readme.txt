============================================

F.O.S.K. is the Fast On-Screen Keyboard PLUGIN for TTLDE, 
requiring only two (!) keystrokes to enter any character. 

How does it work?
-----------------
The on-screen QWERTY keyboard is divided into 7 blocks, each one with a square shape, 
containing 3x3=9 on-screen buttons (therefore icon.png .) 
The first keystroke selects such a block, while the second one takes one of the nine 
chars from the block. After selecting a block, to move up/down/left/right .. the 
arrow keys are used, while to move up-left .. 'square', down-left .. 'cross', down-right
..'circele', up-right .. the 'triangle' is used. To choose the mid char from the block 
use the 'Select' key.

New line ...  press 'O'(circle) twice
Delete....... press 'X'(one keystroke! - you see?)
Shift ....... keep 'L' (left fire) pressed
PrintScreen.. press 'Select' before selecting a block

Installation:
-------------
Latest versions of TTLDE (from v.2.1 on) do support keyboard plugins.
Make shure you have the right version installed. Then Copy 'f.o.s.k.LC' into your 
'TTLDE/OSK' folder. It'll be somewhere on your memory stick ...
'psp/game/luaplayer/Applications/ttlde_2_1/osk/' directory.

If you still do not have luaplayer installed, go to 'luaplayer.org' and grab it.
(Further nice Lua apps downloadable at pspLua.com .)
TTLDE is available from E-ma's site. 

Using f.o.s.k with TTLDE:
------------------------
Run Luaplayer, then start TTLDE.
Press 'Select' > 'Select OSK' > 'f.o.s.k'
The keyboard pops up after perssing 'R'.

Known bugs:
-----------
none. (tested with Lua Player 0.15 and TTLDE 2.1)
